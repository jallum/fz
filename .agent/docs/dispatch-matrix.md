# Dispatch Matrix

`src/dispatch_matrix` is the side-by-side model for the dispatch unification
epic (`fz-v19`). It is deliberately not in the production path yet: today,
`PatternMatrix` still owns source-pattern matching and
`rewrite_closed_union_protocol_dispatch` still owns protocol union rewrites.

The model names four separate concepts so future dispatch work does not grow new
subsystem-specific cascades:

- `Region` is the value-space question an arm asks of a subject: type,
  constructor shape, equality against a literal or pinned value, map-key
  presence, bitstring shape, or a guard predicate.
- `Order` is why an arm wins when regions overlap: source order, type
  specificity, or an explicit materialized order.
- `Outcome` is an opaque handle chosen after an arm wins. Pattern bodies,
  receive accept/reject behavior, protocol direct calls, fallthroughs, and halts
  stay outside the region model.
- `DispatchGraph` is the executable decision shape: tests route to nodes, and
  successful edges carry branch-local proofs and projections.

## Vocabulary Boundary

DispatchMatrix has three layers that must stay separate:

- **Region question:** the semantic question, such as "is subject in this type",
  "is this value a cons cell", "is this key present", or "is this value equal to
  that literal or pinned value".
- **Branch evidence:** what becomes true only on a branch. A cons success can
  project head/tail. A map-key-present success can project the map value, even if
  that value is `nil`; the miss branch records absence. A failed empty-list
  question means "not empty list", not "cons".
- **Backend emission:** the current IR can still use `TypeTest`, equality,
  `IsListCons`, `IsEmptyList`, or `MatcherMapGet` plus `IsMatcherMapMiss`.
  Those names are lowering choices, not DispatchMatrix source vocabulary.

Future dispatch changes should add producers or graph compilation on top of this
model instead of adding one-off matcher or planner dispatch passes. At this
ticket boundary, tests cover only construction invariants; no runtime behavior is
owned by `DispatchMatrix`.
